A pure and simple javascript bitcoin API.

## Principles

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

## Get Started

You can run bitcore on any javascript engine. It's distributed through npm, and you can also find compiled single files here: [bitcore.js](https://bitcore.io/bitcore/dist/bitcore.js) and [bitcore.min.js](https://bitcore.io/bitcore/dist/bitcore.min.js).

```
npm install bitcore
```

Using it on node.js:

```javascript
var bitcore = require('bitcore');

assert(bitcore.Address.isValid(address));
var simpleTx = new bitcore.Transaction();
var simpleTx.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
simpleTx.sign(privateKey);
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](https://bitpay.github.io/bitcore/docs/#!index.md). There's also a [bitcore API reference](https://bitpay.github.io/bitcore/apiref) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, but we're still working on the quality and design of this API reference.

## Security

Please use at your own risk.

Bitcore is still under heavy development and not quite ready for "drop-in" production use. If you find a security issue, please email security@bitcore.io.

## Contributing

Please send pull requests for bug fixes, code optimization, and ideas for improvement.

## Building the browser bundle

To build bitcore full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `browser/bitcore.js` and `browser/bitcore.min.js`.

## Tests

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

Run the tests with mocha:

```sh
gulp test:node
```

Run the tests with karma (uses firefox and chrome):

```sh
gulp test:browser
```

Create a coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it):

```sh
gulp coverage
```
